					<p>I am an individual who is focused on continual improvement and development that's the reason why I decided to do my master's degree, and now I am enrolled on the Sparta programme to gain new skills and to refine the one's I already have. I am a highly curious person that likes to understand why and how things work, I have a passion for technology and I can see the ways it has impacted on society and will continue to do so. </p> 
			
					<p> I have a variety of hobbies, I like to play video games and participate in a number of sports including badminton, pool and swimming. Keeping up with new trends in technology is something I enjoy, and I like meeting likeminded people and having discussions with them on various topics.</p>
